      <h2>Why do we use it?</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>
        It is a long established fact that a reader will be <br>
       distracted by the readable content of a <br>
       ]page when looking at its layout. The point of using <br>
       Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less <br>
       normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using <br>
       'Content here, content here', making it look like<br>
       readable English. Many desktop publishing<br>
       packages and web page editors now use Lorem<br>
       Ipsum as their default model text, and a search<br>
       for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites<br>
       still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved<br>
       over the years, sometimes by accident,<br>
       sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the<br>
       like).
